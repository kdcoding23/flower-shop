Using a tutorial, I added my own code to create a responsive flower shop website.  ðŸŒ¸

---

- Source Code: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLOT0APQzDs">Mr. Web Designer on Youtube</a>

- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- What I added:  I changed the paragraph content in HTML, used :hover in CSS to make all of the icons purple when hovered on, and used JS to create a function in the "Contact Us" section that replaces the contact form with a response when the "Send Message" button is clicked on.

- What I learned:  I learned about media queries in CSS. Being able to create/specify certain characteristics based on the user's browser window can be really helpful and it was really cool to learn!
